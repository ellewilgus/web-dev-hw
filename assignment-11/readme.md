## Assignment 11

1. The difference between padding, margin, and borders is where the space goes. Padding is the amount of space between the content inside the element and the element itself, margin is the space between elements or the space between an element and the edge of a parent element, and borders surround elements and take up additional space around the content.

3. My work cycle for this assignment has been much more back and forth than previous assignments. I was constantly saving the changes to the index and the stylesheet and reloading the browser to see what my changes look like in the browser window. I see why positioning is thought to take up the majority of time when designing a webpage because there is so many things to adjust and play around with until you've achieved the look that you are going for. I feel a little intimidated even after finishing assignment 11 by the idea of complex positioning and changing things even more than I know how. With all of the properties you can include in the style element, no wonder some websites are so sleek looking. Moving forward, I hope the next css website goes a little smoother.
