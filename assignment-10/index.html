    <h1>"To Be or Not To Be"</h1>
    <h2>By <u>William Shakespeare</u></h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p><i>from</i> Hamlet (1603), <i>spoken by Hamlet</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="text" id='cap'>
    To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
    Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
    The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,<br>
    Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br>
    And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep<br>
    No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br>
    The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks<br>
    That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation<br>
    Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,<br>
    To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,<br>
    For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br>
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
    Must give us pause. There's the respect<br>
    That makes Calamity of so long life:<br>
    For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br>
    The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,<br>
    The pangs of disprized Love, the Lawâ€™s delay,<br>
    The insolence of Office, and the Spurns<br>
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
    When he himself might his Quietus make<br>
    With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear,<br>
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
    But that the dread of something after death,<br>
    The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn<br>
    No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,<br>
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br>
    Than fly to others that we know not of.<br>
    Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,<br>
    And thus the Native hue of Resolution<br>
    Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br>
    And enterprises of great pith and moment,<br>
    With this regard their Currents turn awry,<br>
    And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br>
    The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons<br>
    Be all my sins remembered.<br></p>
