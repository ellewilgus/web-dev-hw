# Assignment 2
## Elle Wilgus
I decided to take this class because I was extremely unaware of the physical and technical aspects of web design and the internet in general. I have explored the idea of web design in a visual sense and have come up with designs for web pages but have absolutely no experience with coding or any computer languages. I think that I take the internet and all of its functions for granted and I am excited to obtain a better understanding of how websites work. 

1. I have learned about the benefits of utilizing a VCS, such as accessing history and collaborating with others 
2. I have learned about how IP addresses work and how the different bits correspond with location
3. I have learned how to code text as **bold** or *italics*
