      <h2>Accommodations</h2>

      <p>Luccock Park’s rustic yet comfortable cabins offer a variety of sleeping and gathering areas.  Our largest cabins can sleep as many as 33 and still have room inside, or out on the decks, for meetings & activities or just relaxing in the clear mountain air.  Luccock also has cabins that are one or two family sized.
        All of our cabins are within a short walk to recently renovated bathhouses that have all the amenities, including hot water on demand, that you need to make your stay enjoyable.  Because we’re at almost 6,000′ altitude, it can get chilly at night even in July and August. For your comfort, every cabin has either a wood burning stove or a ceramic heater and all have electricity.  Firewood and kindling are provided free of charge.
        Cabins have a variety of sleeping arrangements from queens to singles and bunks. We do not provide bedding – so you’ll need to bring a sleeping bag or a cozy comforter and your favorite pillow with you! And, rest assured, all cabin spaces (mattresses included) are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after every use.
        Luccock also has seven RV/camper/tent sites with electrical hookups. Maximum RV length is 35′.</p>

        <h2>The Area</h2>

        <p>Yellowstone National Park: The granddaddy of all our National Parks, Yellowstone is home to amazing wildlife and views that defy the imagination.  The historic Gardiner Gate is only a 45 mile drive south of Luccock Park.  There, you will be on the doorstep of Mammoth Hot Springs, and only a short drive from all that Yellowstone has to offer.
            Chico Hot Springs: The hot springs at Chico flow into two open-air mineral Hot Springs pools. While temperatures of the pools fluctuate slightly due to natural elements and occurrences, the large pool averages 96 degrees Fahrenheit and the small pool averages 103 degrees Fahrenheit.
            Livingston Montana: Full of Art Galleries, Museums, and great food Livingston is truly the best of what Montana has to offer.  A modern town with all the amenities. It’s big enough to have everything you want and small enough to make everyone feel at home.
            Fly Fishing: Several area outfitters are available to take advantage of the fantastic Fly Fishing available in the Paradise Valley.  Truly world class fishing awaits any angler of any skill level.
            Pine Creek campground and the hike to the falls are our neighbors, so bring your hiking boots, and hit the trails to see the sights.</p>
