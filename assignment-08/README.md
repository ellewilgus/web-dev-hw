## Assignment 8

1. My experience learning html has been very positive. Even though many of the terms were familiar, I did not understand how the different html elements were used before this unit. Most everything was new to me; however, I found the media elements the most difficult to learn. I had to make a lot of adjustments while adding images and the iframe element to my webpages and that was rather time consuming. I also had a moment in atom while making this site where I thought I had lost a bunch of lines of code and it was not a good feeling. I was able to get all the work back, but it was startling. Otherwise, I would say that I had a good experience and am definitely excited to move on to another assignment.

2. Moving on to CSS, I am very excited to expand on styling. I would say I am a very visual person and I enjoy design elements and the decorative side of digital media. I don't think there is anything in particular that I am anxious about, but I am really excited to experiment with color because I think that could be a lot of fun for some reason.

3. My work cycle for this assignment has been all over the place. I found that I went back to this assignment more times than assignments in the past, meaning that I was starting and stopping a lot. This made things take a lot longer and it was difficult finding where I left off the last time and making progress. I think overall, I could use more practice with including media elements and am looking forward to learning more styling elements to make my webpages more visually appealing.
