## Assignment 5

1. A page can have one main document <head> element and one main document <body> element, each with multiple elements within. The <head> and <body> elements are different because they include different information. The <head> contains document metadata and information on how certain elements of the page will appear. The <body> contains data that is rendered by the browser and actually appears on the client's monitor.

2. Structural and semantic markup contain different information. Structural markup is information regarding the structure of the document. This is the headings, paragraphs, and lists that make up the contents of a page. Semantic markup is information that reinforces the meaning of a word or phrase. This includes placing emphasis on certain words, adding quotes or citations, and specifying things like abbreviations and addresses.

3. My work cycle for this assignment was once again made simpler with the use of the desktop applications Atom, which I am using currently to update my README, and GitHub Desktop. With the help of the walkthrough videos, I have found the assignments fairly achievable and helpful for my individual learning. I made a webpage containing a recipe for Pico de Gallo, which I think is pretty neat. Even though the pages we've designed so far are rather elementary, there is still a sense of pride when the HTML I wrote comes out looking like a real page.
